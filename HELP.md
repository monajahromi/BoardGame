# Board Game Application Help


The Board Game Application is a Spring Boot project that provides a platform for playing various board games. This document provides information on game rules, API endpoints, and configuration options.

### Game Rules
#### Mancala
Mancala is a two-player strategy game. 
Players take turns to sow seeds around the board.
The game ends when a player captures all seeds on their side.
For detailed Mancala rules, refer to Mancala Rules.

#### Mancala Game Play
The player who begins with the first move picks up all the stones in any of his own
six pits, and sows the stones on to the right, one in each of the following pits,
including his own big pit. No stones are put in the opponents' big pit. If the player's
last stone lands in his own big pit, he gets another turn. This can be repeated
several times before it's the other player's turn.
#### Capturing Stones
During the game the pits are emptied on both sides. Always when the last stone
lands in an own empty pit, the player captures his own stone and all stones in the
opposite pit (the other playerâ€™s pit) and puts them in his own (big or little?) pit.
#### The Game Ends
The game is over as soon as one of the sides runs out of stones. The player who
still has stones in his pits keeps them and puts them in his big pit. The winner of
the game is the player who has the most stones in his big pit.

In the Mancala game matrix, the number of rows corresponds to the number of players. 
Each row represents the pits associated with a specific player.
The first row signifies the pits of the first player, the second row is associated with the second player, and so forth. 
Within each row, the last item represents the player's big pit. Initially, at the start of the game, the value in the last position of each row is set to zero.

```
Player 1: [pit, pit, pit, pit, pit, pit, bigPit]
Player 2: [pit, pit, pit, pit, pit, pit, bigPit]
...
Player N: [pit, pit, pit, pit, pit, pit, bigPit]

```
